Things I want to do with this site

### Bugs

- [ ] Safari rotates the back side of the postcard the opposite direction to _every other browser_. Which is extremely annoying. I need to figure out a workaround.
- [ ] Fix locale flags for Windows users
- [ ] In roughly square mode (portrait side), clicking on a postcard jumps to the previous postcard?

### Ideas

- [ ] Include a map, blocking off the parts of the world that I've received a postcard from. Voronoi colouring for countries with more than one?
- [ ] Add forward/back buttons (use these as spacers to vertically centre the portrait version?)
- [ ] Add shadows to the postcards

### Done âœ”

- [x] Add RSS feed for postcards
- [x] Add a very subtle background, scrolling at a slower speed than the window, for parallax effect.
