Things I want to do with this site

### Bugs

- [ ] Safari rotates the back side of the postcard the opposite direction to _every other browser_. Which is extremely annoying. I need to figure out a workaround.
- [ ] Fix locale flags for Windows users

### Ideas

- [ ] Include a map, blocking off the parts of the world that I've received a postcard from. Voronoi colouring for countries with more than one?
- [ ] Add forward/back buttons (use these as spacers to vertically centre the portrait version?)

### Done âœ”

- [x] Add RSS feed for postcards
